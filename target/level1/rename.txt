Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed 
applications, licensed under the Apache v2 license. It supports the running of applications 
on large clusters of commodity hardware. The Hadoop framework transparently provides both 
reliability and data motion to applications. Hadoop implements a computational paradigm 
named map/reduce, where the application is divided into many small fragments of work, each of 
which may be executed or re-executed on any node in the cluster. In addition, it provides 
a distributed file system that stores data on the compute nodes, providing very high aggregate 
bandwidth across the cluster. Both map/reduce and the distributed file system are designed so 
that node failures are automatically handled by the framework.[1] It enables applications to work 
with thousands of computation-independent computers and petabytes of data. Hadoop was derived from 
Google's MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers.
